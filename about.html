			<h3>What is Re2pect?</h3>
			<p>Re2Pect is literally your worth in the LHS Percussion Section. If you are on the Re2pect board, congratulations! You have made it to the top, or bottom, of worth in the LHS Percussion section! That means the admins find you either really worth something, or want you to radically change your belief systems, behaviors, and actions, as to please them. If you aren't on the board, you are currently average, which is bad. That means you can easily slip to the bottom of the Re2pect chart, and your life will get significantly worse.</p>
			<p>Bottom line: Re2pect is the most important aspect of your life.</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id = "gaining">Gaining Re2pect</h3>
			<p>You can gain Re2pect through the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Doing something cool</li>
				<li>Performing a 1 minute uke solo</li>
				<li>Working at McDanks</li>
				<li>saying something <strong>Uber</strong> funny</li>
				<li>Add something worthwhile to the percussion room (see below)</li>
				<li>Win game of Fortnite, PUBG, or Rules of Survival (provide proof)</li>
				<li>Win a game of Bang Boi Ball</li>
				<li>Score a 3 in Bang Boi Ball</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you can see, there are lots of ways to get started earning Re2pect!</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id = "losing">Losing Re2pect</h3>
			<p>While there are many ways to earn your way up to the top, there are also ways to hurt your Re2pect score... these include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Having Brain Cancer</li>
				<li>Having a brother who is better than you</li>
				<li>Saying something stupid</li>
				<li>Talking back to Re2pect admins</li>
				<li>Having a low Re2pect score</li>
				<li>Missing a 3 in bang boi ball</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Make sure you're careful not to do any of these things, and you will be fine!</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Worthwhile Percussion Room Additions</h3>
			<p>When adding something worthwhile to the percussion room, it's always best to know what the admins like. For example, LOWRIN (Grad. 2018) added a Uke to the room for a good two months. That is a very worthwhile addition. Another is the bang boi ball setup that existed for a short period of time from Voss (Assistant to the Drum Captain 2018-2019) and J-Nut (Assistant to the Assistant to the Drum Captain 2018-2019). That is worthwhile. Even the respect poster, put up by Bren-Ten (Drum Captian 2018-2019), is a great addition and can help the room feel like good.</p>
